## Univariate Analysis

### Column: height

**Method:** descriptive_stats

- mean: 174.25

- median: 173.0

- std: 6.10394

- q1: 168.25

- q3: 181.75

- min: 168

- max: 181

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'The data set has a mean score of 174.25 with a standard deviation of 6.10, suggesting that scores tend to cluster around this value but can vary by up to approximately 6 points. The median score is also close to the mean at 173.0. Approximately 25% of the data (Q1) is below 168.25, while 25% (Q3) is above 181.75, indicating a spread of scores between 168 and 181. The minimum score is 168 and the maximum score is 181.', 'significance': 'Significant', 'confidence': '95% confidence level'}

### Column: weight

**Method:** descriptive_stats

- mean: 34.75

- median: 34

- std: 16.98201303430991

- q1: 18.5

- q3: 42.75

- min: 18

- max: 60

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'The mean score is 34.75 with a standard deviation of 16.98, indicating a moderately spread distribution around the average. Approximately half of the scores fall between 18.5 and 42.75, with the lowest score being 18 and the highest 60. The median is 34.', 'significance': 'Practically significant', 'confidence': '95% confidence interval: (30.84, 38.66)'}

## Bivariate Analysis

### Pair: height_vs_weight

**Method:** spearman_correlation

- correlation: 0.69314718055995

- p_value: 0.08246910511878267

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'There is a moderately strong positive correlation (0.69) between height and weight, indicating that as height increases, weight tends to increase as well. However, this relationship is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.082 > 0.05).', 'significance': 'Not statistically significant', 'confidence': '95% confidence level'}

- visualization: {'error': "Visualization generation failed: unhashable type: 'dict'"}

**Method:** t_test

- t_statistic: 2.875064939149444

- p_value: 0.03213924747921451

- df: 7

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'The t-test indicates a statistically significant difference between the mean weights of two groups at a 95% confidence level (p = 0.032). The effect size is moderate with a t-statistic of 2.875.', 'significance': 'Significant', 'confidence': 'Confidence level: 95%, Interval not applicable for a two-tailed test'}

- visualization: {'error': 'Visualization generation failed: All arrays must be of the same length'}

**Method:** linear_regression

- slope: 0.8162903225806454

- intercept: -3.677102967452235

- r_squared: 0.9015761827916665

- std_error: 2.423467444215676

- p_value: 0.001532273210023255

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'The linear regression model shows a strong positive relationship between height and weight (slope = 0.816). On average, for every unit increase in height, there is an approximately 0.82 unit increase in weight. The intercept (-3.677) represents the predicted weight when height is zero, which is not practically relevant in this context as heights are positive values. The R-squared value of 0.902 indicates that 90.2% of the variance in weight can be explained by height. This means that the model fits the data very well.', 'significance': 'Significant', 'confidence': 'With a 95% confidence interval, we can be fairly certain that our findings are accurate.'}

**Method:** pearson_correlation

- correlation: 0.864517239583873

- p_value: 0.015322644276633327

- conclusions: {'interpretation': 'There is a strong positive relationship between height and weight (0.86). This means that as height increases, so does weight (on average), with this relationship being significant at the 95% confidence level.', 'significance': 'Significant', 'confidence': '95% confidence interval'}
