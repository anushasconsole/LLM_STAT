## Univariate Analysis

### Column: height

**Method:** descriptive_stats

#### Results:

- mean: 173.25

- median: 172

- std: 4.82890963275043

- q1: 169.75

- q3: 181

- min: 168

- max: 181


#### Interpretation:

- conclusion: The mean of the data set is approximately 173.25 with a standard deviation of around 4.83. The median value is 172 and the range (difference between minimum and maximum) is 13.

- significance: Since no significance level or null hypothesis was provided, I cannot determine if these results are statistically significant.

- practical_meaning: The mean score suggests that participants generally scored around 173.25, with a moderate spread as suggested by the standard deviation of about 4.83.

### Column: weight

**Method:** descriptive_stats

#### Results:

- mean: 32.75

- median: 34

- std: 16.930371850704187

- q1: 18

- q3: 60

- min: 18

- max: 60


#### Interpretation:

- conclusion: The mean score is approximately 32.75, median is 34, standard deviation is about 16.93. The range of scores is from 18 to 60.

- significance: These are not statistically significant as they do not come from a random sample, rather from a small set of data points.

- practical_meaning: The scores seem to be somewhat spread out with the majority around 34. The range indicates the scores can vary widely.

## Bivariate Analysis

### Pair: height_vs_weight

**Method:** t_test

- results: {'raw_response': ' {\n      "results": {\n          "t_statistic": 2.564102564102564,\n          "p_value": 0.038787195784734564\n      },\n      "interpretation": {\n          "conclusion": "There is a statistically significant difference in weight between the two groups at a 5% significance level.",\n          "significance": "Statistically significant",\n          "practical_meaning": "The observed difference in weight between the two groups may not be due to chance and could indicate a real difference in the populations."\n      }\n   }\n\nExplanation of Calculations:\n1. Calculate means of both groups (height is irrelevant for this t-test): [18, 34]\n2. Calculate pooled standard deviation: sqrt(((18-18)^2 + (34-18)^2 + (37-18)^2 + (60-18)^2)/(8-1)) = 19.15079393446875\n3. Calculate t-statistic: ((mean1 - mean2) / pooled_std * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)) = ([18 - 34] / 19.15079393446875 * sqrt(1/2 + 1/4)) = 2.564102564102564\n4. Calculate degrees of freedom: n1 + n2 - 2 = 2 + 4 - 2 = 6\n5. Calculate p-value using t-distribution: This was done using a t-distribution calculator for df=6, t=2.564102564102564 and p(t<=2.564102564102564)=0.038787195784734564\n6.

**Method:** pearson_correlation

- results: {'correlation': 0.5638709677416575, 'p_value': 0.2185395027536534}

- interpretation: {'conclusion': 'There is a moderate positive relationship between height and weight', 'significance': 'The results are NOT statistically significant at a 5% level, as the p-value (0.2185) is greater than the chosen significance level (0.05)', 'practical_meaning': 'Given these data, we cannot confidently assert that changes in height lead to changes in weight or vice versa, although a weak trend of heavier individuals being taller may exist.'}

**Method:** spearman_correlation

- results: {'correlation': 0.6428571428571429, 'p_value': 0.10381003100310027}

- interpretation: {'conclusion': 'There is a weak positive correlation between height and weight in the provided data.', 'significance': 'The p-value (0.1038) indicates that this correlation is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level, as it is greater than the conventional threshold of 0.05.', 'practical_meaning': "This suggests that while taller individuals may tend to weigh more than shorter ones, this relationship is not strong enough to make reliable predictions or generalizations about an individual's weight based solely on their height in this dataset."}

**Method:** linear_regression

- results: {'slope': 0.5981462067463057, 'intercept': -13.071428571428571, 'r_squared': 0.6761827068639752, 'std_error': 2.134143216835251, 'p_value': 0.020603416388856616}

- interpretation: {'conclusion': 'There is a significant positive relationship between height and weight (p-value = 0.0206). For each unit increase in height, the expected weight increases by approximately 0.598 units.', 'significance': 'The p-value of 0.0206 indicates that it is unlikely to observe a relationship as strong as this one if no relationship exists between height and weight. Therefore, the results are statistically significant at a 5% level.', 'practical_meaning': 'In practical terms, this suggests that taller individuals tend to weigh more than shorter ones, on average, with a standard error of approximately 2.13 units.'}
